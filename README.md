## Galleria Mia       [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/chi-cicadas-2015/galleriamia.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/chi-cicadas-2015/galleriamia.png)       [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/chi-cicadas-2015/galleriamia/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/chi-cicadas-2015/galleriamia?branch=master)




Born of frustration, Galleria Mia was inspired by a desire to have a simple mobile website where an Artist could showcase their works on a smartphone. We wanted intuitive and responsive controls, housed in a framework that skillfully presents the artworks without distracting from them.
